# Unet-Brain-Segmentation

Unet models optimized with the Dice Loss and binary cross entropy loss were developed for brain tumor segmentation. 

Dataset:  
The dataset contains brain MR images together with manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks.
The images were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).
They correspond to 110 patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lower-grade glioma collection with at least fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and genomic cluster data available.
